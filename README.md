Sensori-Motor Research
======================
Conventional machine-learning systems are force-fed data by a collection
of scripts and control panels; they "data process" and "machine learn"
for a while, using up CPU time, and eventually producing some answer
that some customer, client or user wanted. This kind of forced
processing is the modern variant of what used to be called "batch
processing". The obvious industrial alternative is continuous-flow
processing. A canonical example might be the self-driving car: it gets
continuous data from a variety of sensors, synthesizes that data, and
arrives at "real-time", millisecond-by-millisecond motor-control
decisions.

Smart engineers have no problem creating both batch and continous-flow
systems. Its a standard engineering task pervasive in industry, from
baking bread to creating plastics. It's, well, "obvious". Like all good
things that are obvious, it can be made teh topic of research, and so
here we are.
