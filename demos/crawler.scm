; Up to this point, the demo has been relatively straight-forward. At
; this point, though, the confusion begins. In the above, how does one
; know that the `explore-dirs` rule is getting arguments of the correct
; kind? This takes a bit of mental effort and double-checking. Playing
; with the guile REPL, run `(cog-execute! (Write fstream-observer ...))`
; and verify that what is printed can be pattern-matched by the input
; (acceptance) pattern to `explore-dirs`. But this takes some focus and
; concentration.
;
; This is a problem. Atomese was never meant to be a human-friendly
; programming environment; it was meant to be algorithm-friendly.
; But debuggability is an issue. This is why Sensory has a focus on
; connections and connection types: the connection types help verify
; valid connections. But even then, this shifts the issue to a
; different location. The difficulty of understanding what the above
; does is a real problem, even though what it does is nearly trivial
; in any conventional programming language: its just a directory listing,
; two levels down. Dealing with this is an open, unsolved problem.
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------
; loop-de-loop.
; The `explore-dirs` rule above was written to accept a directory
; listing as input, and then enter each subdir, and create a directory
; listing for that. Since it outputs the same format of data as it
; accepts as input, it is ready-made to be used in a recursive fashion.
; This part of the demo shows this.
;
; To wire the output of the rule back to the input, the most direct
; solution is to place initial data at a fixed memory location, and then
; run the rule, uptating the location with each iteration. The
; "location" here is just some Atom and some Key indicating a Value
; stored there. The first part of the demo is simply to seed an
; initial value at that location.

; Designate the directory to be crawled
(define sense-root (Sensory "file:///tmp"))

; Set starting location. The crawler expects a directory name, tagged
; with a file-type. The easiest way to get this is to just ask for it.
; The alternative is to hand-jigger an appropriate form, which is OK,
; but defeats the idea of only using pure Atomese and the sensory API.

; Run the step once, and only once.
(cog-execute! looper)

; Run it again. Repeat till satsified that directories are being

(cog-execute! looper)

; Reset the root, as desired. Since each exploration goes one step
; deeper, eventually you run out of subdirectories, and so resetting
; the base is needed, if you want to continue playing with the demo.
(cog-execute! (set-initial-root (Sensory "file:///tmp")))

;------------------------------------------------------------------
; To be truly recursive, the single-step execution needs to be placed in
; a loop. Atomese does not define any kind of "loop until done" Atom.
; Perhaps it should? However, a tail recursive loop can be written in
; stock Atomese. This is shown here.

; First, define a predicate that will halt the tail-recursion.
; Recall looper-loc is defined above: its where the current directory
; listing is held. The `SizeOf` atom merely looks at its current size.
(Define (DefinedPredicate "keep going?")
	(GreaterThan (SizeOf looper-loc) (Number 0)))

; Try it. Recall (stv 0 1) is false, and (stv 1 1) is true.
(cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "keep going?"))

; Define a tail-recursive loop.
; The only "tricky part" is the `(True looper)` clause. This executes
; the looper step, and then returns true, so that the SequentialAnd
; sequences to the next step.
(Define
	(DefinedPredicate "My tail-recursive loop")

; Run it. This is unexciting: it sits there a while, and then stops.
; to prove that something happened, we can either insert a print
; statement into the loop, or create some side effects, such as dumping
; the directory listing into AtomSpace. This is done next.
(cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "My tail-recursive loop"))

; BTW: if you plan to change the DefinedPredicate, you have to delete it
; first. This is because `DefineLink` does not allow multiple
; definitions. Deleting means extracting from the AtomSpace, like so:

; Print the filenames by piping them to an xterm. An xterm is used

; Listing /usr is fun too, if you like looking at terminal spew.

;------------------------------------------------------------------
; The below demonstrates interactive I/O with the xterm. In this case,
; the loop iteration pauses at each step, waiting for keyboard input.
; The xterm TerminalStream is designed to hang until there is input;
; this is used to pause the recursion.

; The pause is performed by comparing terminal input to a given string.
; The easiest way to do this is to use `StreamEqual` to compare the
; first item in a stream to a string. `StreamEqual` papers over some
; rough spots in usability to make stream compares a little simpler.
(cog-evaluate! (StreamEqual term-loc (Item "xxx\n")))

; There is also a more precise but more complicated way of getting the
; terminal stream input, and comparing it to a value. It works like so.
; Executing `term-loc` returns
;     (TerminalStream (StringValue "whatever was typed\n"))
; and not just the StringValue itself. To compare to that, we must
; construct two Atoms that encode Values. First, the
;     (StringOf (Type 'StringValue) (Item "xxx\n"))
; is used to convert (Item "xxx\n") to (StringValue "xxx\n") and then
; the LinkSignature wraps it up, creating the Value
;     (LinkValue (StringValue "xxx\n"))
; The equality check proceeds, because the TerminalStream is a kind of
; LinkValue, and so then the StringValues are compared for equality.
;
; And now you understand why StreamEqual is better than Equal for this
; particular demo. Try the below a few times.
