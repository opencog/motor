A colection of examples are given below. These all "work", and

towards the experimental: although they illustrate key ideas and
concepts, they are subject to change. This is not the final design.

* `filesys-api.py` -- An example of looking at directory contents,
  using the Atomese python bindings. This is a port of the first portion
  of the `filesys.scm` example in the Sensory project.
