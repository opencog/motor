# Most Atomese work is done in scheme. This particular demo ensures that
# concepts expressed in scheme also work in python. This is needed,
# because many programmers are more comfortable with python.
#
# This file is a python version of the scheme variant `filesys-api.scm`
# also in this directory. Both show the same things, more or less.
#
# Both of these are derived from the `filesys.scm` demo from the
# `Sensory` project examples.
