; filesys-api.scm -- File metadata demo
;
; The FileSysStream sensory node generates a stream of StringValues
; that correspond to files in a file system. It can generate listings
; of filenames, filetypes and other file metadata. This demo provides
; a short low-level review of the available metadata. It's "low level"
; in that it does not deal with wiring issues; it just illustrates
; the "connectors" or "legs" on the component.
;
; The `filesys-api.py` file shows roughly the same demo, but in python.
